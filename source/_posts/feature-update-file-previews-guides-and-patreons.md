A few weeks ago we announced a couple new features and one of our biggest milestones - [A neural style transfer in the Browser](/2017/09/26/a-neural-style-transfer-in-the-browser/). Today we would like to give you another update with exciting new things that landed in the codebase lately. Read on for more information!

### File Previews

After implementing the ability to [save outputs of lab executions](/2017/09/13/feature-update-saving-outputs-better-console-and-more/), we thought it would be useful to provide a way to preview the generated output as well, so users don't have to download it every single time just to take a quick look.

Starting today, output files that are images can be previewed right on MachineLabs, making it easier to analyze your generated data!

{% asset_img "previewing-output-data.gif" "Previewing output data" %}

We support gifs, jpegs, tiffs and png files and will continue to add support for other file types as well.

### Brand new documentation

One of the trickiest things when getting started with Machine Learning is... getting started with Machine Learning. We want to lower the barrier of entry as much as possible by providing a platform that makes it easy to perform your own Machine Learning experiments. Crucial to this is having guides, tutorials and documentation about how to use and do certain things.

Today we're super thrilled to announce that we have brand new docs available over at [docs.machinelabs.ai](https://docs.machinelabs.ai) containing a **Quickstart** and many other chapters to explore how MachineLabs can help.

Consider this documentation as a living document. We'll continue to keep it up to date, adding new sections and examples, as well as tutorials and guides to support you on your Machine Learning journey. At this point we'd also like to make a big shout-out to the wonderful people at [VueJS](https://vuejs.org). We forked their documentation and adjusted it to our needs, which enabled us to get something down the road that fast!

### Support the project on Patreon

MachineLabs, Inc is a small, dedicated and 100 % bootstrapped company. Our main goal is to provide the community with better tools to move the whole Machine Learning ecosystem forward.

We believe that independent and community-focused solutions are very much needed to democratize Machine Learning.

Everything we do right now, building features, ensuring that services are available, writing guides and tutorials - all that is purely financed out of our own pockets.

We hope MachineLabs will be a profitable company in the future but as of today we need your support so we can work on implementing the features you need to to make Machine Learning more fun.

That's why we've created a Patreon page where you can pledge and support the development of MachineLabs. Check it out right here: [www.patreon.com/machinelabs](https://www.patreon.com/machinelabs).

If you are a developer it makes sense to back this project to get rewarded with simpler, better tools and online resources for Machine Learning.

If you are a company it makes even more sense to back this project as you are increasing your chances to find talents in the future.

Thanks to everyone who supports us on this journey!
