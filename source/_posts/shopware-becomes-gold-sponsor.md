Making Machine Learning accessible and explorable for everyone is at the very heart of our mission and we‚Äôve been working tirelessly over the last months to work towards this goal. In fact, we are pretty happy with what we‚Äôve accomplished over the recent months with a very small team.

Of course, running MachineLabs is not only a time intensive endeavor but also a financial one. We don‚Äôt have any pressure to become profitable quickly. When it comes to financials, we actually have just one focus: 

Making sure that MachineLabs continues to be well funded to build the Machine Learning future that we envision.   

That‚Äôs why we started a [crowd funding campaign on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/machinelabs). With such a campaign, we enable people who believe in what we‚Äôre doing to support MachineLabs by backing the project. In return, we can offer exclusive benefits and features to those supports, making it a win-win for all of us. 

Today, we couldn‚Äôt be more excited to unveil that **[Shopware](https://en.shopware.com/) has become a Gold Sponsor** to support us on our mission.

Shopware is one of the world‚Äôs leading e-commerce platforms and understands the important role of Machine Learning in our world today. In fact, not only does Shopware become a patron of MachineLabs, we‚Äôll also be working closely together to make sure MachineLabs becomes a solid platform for advanced Machine Learning use cases.

We couldn‚Äôt be more excited about this step and say: Thank you Shopware! üôè
